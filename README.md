[SDTM](https://pointcrosslifesciences.com/sdtm-everything-that-you-need-to-know/) (Study Data Tabulation Model) and ADaM (Analysis Data Model) are both standard formats used to organize and analyze data from clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry.

The main difference between SDTM and ADaM is their intended purpose. SDTM is used to organize and standardize the data collected during a clinical trial, while ADaM is used to structure and analyze the data for statistical analysis.

SDTM is a standard format for organizing raw data from clinical trials, such as laboratory measurements, demographics, and adverse events. SDTM provides a consistent structure for organizing data and makes it easier for regulatory authorities to review and analyze the data.

ADaM, on the other hand, is a standard format for organizing analysis-ready datasets derived from the [raw data collected in a clinical trial](https://pointcrosslifesciences.com/edatavalidator/). The purpose of ADaM is to facilitate statistical analysis of the data to support regulatory submissions. ADaM datasets typically include variables that are specific to the statistical analysis, such as derived variables or statistical analysis flags.

In summary, SDTM is used to organize raw data from clinical trials, while ADaM is used to structure and analyze data for statistical analysis. Both standards are important for ensuring data quality, consistency, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
